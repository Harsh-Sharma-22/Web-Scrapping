    <h1>Web Scraping GDP Per Capita State-wise Using BeautifulSoup</h1>
    
   <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>The goal of this project is to collect GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita data for various states from a specific website. We will use BeautifulSoup, a Python library for web scraping, to extract the required information from the website.</p>

  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>Before you can run the web scraping script, you need to ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Python 3.x: You can download and install Python from the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">official website</a>.</li>
        <li>Required Python Libraries:
            <ul>
                <li>BeautifulSoup4: Install it using pip with the following command:<br><code>pip install beautifulsoup4</code></li>
                <li>Requests: Install it using pip with the following command:<br><code>pip install requests</code></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Clone the Repository:</strong> Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:<br><code>git clone https://github.com/Harsh-Sharma-22/Web-Scrapping.git</code></li>
        <li><strong>Navigate to the Project Directory:</strong> Change your current working directory to the project folder:<br><code>cd web-scraping</code></li>
        <li><strong>Run the Web Scraping Script:</strong> Execute the web scraping script by running the following command:<br><code>python web_scrapping.py</code></li>
    </ol>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>The <code>web_scrapping.py</code> script contains the web scraping logic using BeautifulSoup. You can modify the script to scrape data from your target website by updating the URL and the HTML element selectors as needed.</p>



  <h2>Data Output</h2>
    <p>The collected GDP per capita data will be saved to a CSV file named <code>gdp_per_capita.csv</code> in the project directory. You can then use this CSV file for further analysis or visualization.</p>
